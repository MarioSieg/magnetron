# Magnetron Python
This is the Python root for the Magnetron project.<br>
The Magnetron Python API can be found in the [Framework](magnetron_framework).
Examples of how to use the Python API can be found in the [Examples](examples) folder.
The Magnetron Viewer is a simple GUI program, which can be used to inspect .magnetron files.

## Python Dependencies
The requirements.txt file contains all the dependencies for the Magnetron Python **and the examples** but Magnetron itself does **not** require big dependencies for to run.<br>
For using magnetron itself with minimal dependencies, install the core [requirements](magnetron_framework/requirements.txt) only.
